              Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the <time datetime="1870">1870<sub>s<sub></time> and gained practical experience in the early <time datetime="1880">1880<sub>s</sub></time> working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.
              He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his
              ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in <time datetime="1888">1888</time>, earned
              him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.

            <p class="grey-light">Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first
          ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.

            <p class="grey">Throughout the <time datetime="1890">1890<sub>s</sub></time>, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In <time datetime="1893">1893</time>, he made pronouncements on the possibility
              of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete
              it.

            <p class="grey-light">After Wardenclyffe, Tesla went on to try to develop a series of inventions in the <time datetime="1910">1910<sub>s</sub></time> and <time datetime="1920"1920<sub>s</sub></time> with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, he lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. Tesla died in
              New York City in <time datetime="07-01-1943"> January 1943</time>. His work fell into relative obscurity following his death, but in <time datetime="1960">1960</time>, the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence
              in popular interest in Tesla since the <time datetime="1990">1990<sub>s</sub></time>. His intellectual achievements and originality have made him named by many a genius.
